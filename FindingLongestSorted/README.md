# Finding Longest Sorted Sublist in a linked list

In scope of CSE-222(Data Structure and Algorithms)

## Problem definition 

* Given a single linked list of integers, we want to find the maximum length sorted sublist in
this list. For example for the list L= {1, 9, 2, 7, 20, 13} the returned list should be S = {2, 7,
20}.
+ Write an iterative function which performs this task.
+ Write a recursive function for the same purpose.
